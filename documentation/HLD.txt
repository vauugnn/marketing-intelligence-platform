Marketing Attribution & Intelligence Platform

Challenge 2: Marketing Data Intelligence System 5
Problem Statement
Marketing performance is measured by individual channels, but operators lack visibility into how all marketing efforts work together as a system, making it difficult to understand reinforcement, isolation, and overall system health.
Your Mission
Build a channel-agnostic system that evaluates marketing as an interconnected ecosystem, helping operators understand how different channels reinforce or undermine one another, where momentum is being created or lost, and which parts of the system are underperforming relative to their role.

THE PROBLEM
Maria spends ₱10,000/month on Facebook, Google Ads, Instagram, HubSpot, and Mailchimp. She gets 50 sales worth ₱100,000.
Problem 1: Who actually gets credit?
* Facebook claims: 20 sales
* Google claims: 15 sales
* Mailchimp claims: 10 sales
* Total claimed: 45 | Actual: 50
Problem 2: How do they work together?
* Do channels help each other?
* Which combinations actually work?
* What should she cut or grow?
She manages channels individually, but they work as a system.

OUR SOLUTION
Connect your existing marketing tools. We pull all the data, cross-reference everything, and show you:
1. What each channel actually did (verified performance through dual tracking: our custom pixel + Google Analytics 4)
2. How channels work together (system intelligence through visual network mapping)
3. What to do next (AI recommendations with financial impact)
Dual tracking: Our custom pixel + Google Analytics 4 cross-verification catches what each system misses, giving you 85-95% accuracy vs 60-70% from single sources. We verify conversions when both agree, expose platform over-attribution, and send only verified conversions back via CAPI so your ads optimize better.
System intelligence: Marketing isn't isolated channels—it's an ecosystem. We reveal synergies (Facebook + Email = 5x together), reinforcement (45% of Google searches follow Facebook ads), isolation (Instagram Ads in only 4% of journeys), and conflicts (contradictory messaging killing performance). Then AI tells you exactly how to coordinate combinations, cut isolated spend, and orchestrate your entire system instead of optimizing channels in silos.

HOW IT WORKS (FLOW OF THE APP)

Step 1: Connect Your Tools
Plug in your existing stack in minutes, no migration, no hassle. One-click OAuth to whatever you already have:
* Google Analytics 4
* Meta (Facebook/Instagram)
* Google Ads
* HubSpot
* Mailchimp
* Our tracking pixel
We work with what you have - no need for all platforms.
Step 2: We Pull & Cross-Reference Everything (Automatic)
Historical Data (What We Can See Immediately)
Even if you just installed our pixel today, we pull historical performance from your existing tools:
From Payment Processor (Stripe/PayPal):
* Past sales (6-12 months)
* Revenue, customer emails, order amounts
From Ad Platforms (Facebook, Google, Instagram):
* Last 90 days of campaign performance
* Spend, clicks, claimed conversions
From Email Platforms (Mailchimp, HubSpot):
* Last 6 months of campaigns
* Opens, clicks, claimed conversions
From Google Analytics 4/GA4 (if already installed):
* Historical conversion data
* Traffic sources and user journeys
* Previous 12-16 months available
What We Show Immediately (Day 1):
Platform claims vs actual sales:
* Facebook claims: 20 conversions
* Google claims: 15 conversions
* Mailchimp claims: 10 conversions
* Stripe actual sales: 50 purchases
Problem visible immediately: Platforms claim 45 sales, but Stripe shows 50. Double-counting confirmed.
What Unlocks After 30 Days:
Our pixel needs 30 days to observe customer behavior patterns.
After 30 days, you get:
* Complete customer journeys (Facebook → Email → Purchase)
* Channel synergies (Facebook + Email = 5X)
* Multi-touch attribution (Time-Decay, Position-Based)
* System health score and AI recommendations
Why 30 days? Pixel must track real visitors across multiple touchpoints to detect how channels work together.
Step 3: Individual Performance Table
A breakdown of each channel's revenue, spend, ROI, and overall performance rating.

	AI insights per channel:
* Email: "High efficiency, in 70% of conversions"
* Facebook: "Drives 45% of Google searches"
* Instagram Ads: "Isolated, 96% don't convert"
Step 4: Interactive System Map

Step 5: AI Recommendations
✅ Keep & Scale: "Facebook and Email have 5x synergy. Email Facebook clickers within 24 hours for maximum impact."
⚠️ Optimize: "Google Ads captures 45% of Facebook ad viewers but has low ROI (212%). Reduce cost or improve landing pages."
🔴 Stop: "Instagram Ads isolated (96% alone), losing money (-50% ROI). Cut to save ₱4,000/month."
Total Impact: +₱84,000/month

VALUE PROPOSITION
For Businesses:
* Know which channels actually work (individually & together)
* Stop wasting 20-30% of budget
* Grow revenue 2-3x in 3 months
* Save 10+ hours/month
Market Overview:
* Market Size: $3.1B (2022) → $10.6B (2032) at 13% CAGR
* Target Market: 65M businesses running digital ads, 90% lack proper attribution
* Target Customer: SMBs spending $5K-$50K/month on ads ($500K-$10M revenue)
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
What No Competitor Has:
1. Dual Tracking = 95% Accuracy: Cross-verify Pixel + GA4 to catch what each system misses (vs 70% GA4-only)
2. Expose Platform Lies: Facebook claims 20 sales, Google claims 15, Mailchimp claims 10—but Stripe shows 50. We verify claims against actual payment data
3. System Intelligence: See Facebook + Email = 5x synergy, Google catches 45% of Facebook viewers, Instagram Ads 96% isolated—relationships competitors miss
4. Visual Network Map: Interactive node chart where thick lines = synergy, broken lines = waste, bigger nodes = revenue
5. CAPI Feedback Loop: Send verified conversions back to platforms so they optimize better (+15% ROAS automatically)
6. AI Decisions: Get specific actions (Cut Instagram Ads = save ₱4K/month, 95% confidence) instead of vague insights
vs Key Competitors:

	What they CAN’T do
	What WE CAN do
	Northbeam


	* Can't show system-level intelligence at SMB (small medium business) pricing
	* Enterprise accuracy at SMB pricing
	Triple Whale


	* Can't verify platform claims against actual sales (platform ≠ payment processor)
	* Cross-platform truth
* Dual tracking (Pixel + GA4)
* Visual system map + AI recommendations
	Cometly
	* Can't show how channels work together as a system
	* System intelligence (synergies/isolation)
	Bottom Line: Enterprise accuracy + System intelligence + AI decisions at SMB pricing

CONCLUSION
What We Built: A marketing intelligence platform that cross-references all your marketing data to expose the truth: which channels actually drive revenue, how they work together as a system, and exactly what to do next—verified through dual tracking and visualized through interactive system maps with AI-powered recommendations.
Who It's For: SMBs, e-commerce, and agencies spending $5K-$50K/month on ads who are tired of guessing which channels work, wasting 20-30% of their budget on isolated campaigns, and making decisions based on platform claims that don't match reality.
The Outcome: Stop double-counting. Stop wasting money on isolated channels. Stop optimizing in silos. See the truth about how your marketing actually works as a system, cut what's failing, scale what's working together, and grow revenue 2-3x in 3 months.
Why This Wins: We're the only platform that combines enterprise-level accuracy (95% via dual tracking) with system-level intelligence (visual channel synergies) at SMB pricing ($99-499/month)—solving the problem everyone else ignores: marketing is a system, not isolated channels.
