# Hackathon Pitch Guide

## The 60-Second Elevator Pitch

> "Every business running ads has the same problem — Facebook says it drove 20 sales, Google says 15, Mailchimp says 10. That's 45 claimed sales. But Stripe shows only 50 actual purchases. Platforms are lying, double-counting, and you're making budget decisions on bad data.
>
> We built a platform that installs a lightweight tracking pixel on your site, captures every purchase, and sends that data back to each platform asking: *did this customer actually come from you?* Then we cross-reference every response to give you the truth — with 95% accuracy instead of the industry standard 70%.
>
> But here's what makes us different: we don't just show individual channel performance. We show you how channels work *together as a system*. We found that Facebook + Email has a 5x synergy — people who see a Facebook ad and then get an email are 5x more likely to buy. No other tool at SMB pricing shows that.
>
> The result? Business owners stop wasting 20-30% of their budget, cut isolated channels, scale what works together, and grow revenue 2-3x in 3 months."

## How to Structure a 5-Minute Demo

### Minute 1 — The Problem (Show, Don't Tell)

Open with Maria's story. Put real numbers on screen:

| Platform Claims | Sales |
|----------------|-------|
| Facebook | 20 |
| Google | 15 |
| Mailchimp | 10 |
| **Total Claimed** | **45** |
| **Stripe Actual** | **50** |

Say: *"45 claimed vs 50 actual. Platforms are double-counting AND missing 5 sales nobody took credit for. Maria is making budget decisions on fiction."*

### Minute 2 — The Solution (Live App Demo)

Walk through the app flow:

1. **Integrations Page** — Show the one-click OAuth connections. *"Maria connects her existing tools in under 2 minutes. No migration, no new tools to learn."*
2. **Dashboard** — Show the performance table. *"Day 1, she already sees verified revenue per channel. Email has 3,900% ROI. Instagram Ads is losing money at -50% ROI."*

### Minute 3 — The Secret Weapon (System Intelligence)

Switch to the **Data Intelligence** page:

1. **Data Pipeline visualization** — *"Here's what happens under the hood. When a customer buys, our pixel captures their data, sends it to each platform for verification, cross-references every response, and generates verified attribution at 95% accuracy."*
2. **Journey Patterns** — *"We track the actual path customers take. The #1 pattern is Facebook → Email → Purchase. 42 conversions followed this exact path."*
3. **Channel Roles** — *"Facebook is an 'introducer' — it starts journeys. Email is a 'closer' — it finishes them. Instagram Ads? Isolated. It's not part of any successful journey."*

### Minute 4 — The System Map (Visual Wow Factor)

Open the **System Map** page and expand it:

- *"Thick green lines = strong synergy. Facebook and Email are deeply connected."*
- *"Big nodes = high revenue. Small red nodes = underperformers."*
- *"This is what no competitor shows at SMB pricing — your marketing as an interconnected system, not isolated silos."*

### Minute 5 — The Punchline (AI Recommendations + Business Impact)

Open the **Recommendations** page:

- **Scale**: *"Facebook + Email = 5x synergy. Email Facebook clickers within 24 hours."*
- **Optimize**: *"Google Ads captures 45% of Facebook viewers but has low ROI. Fix the landing page."*
- **Stop**: *"Cut Instagram Ads. It's isolated, losing money. Save ₱4,000/month."*
- **Total Impact: +₱84,000/month**

Close with: *"Maria went from guessing to knowing. She cut Instagram Ads, scaled Facebook+Email, and her revenue grew 2.5x in 3 months."*

## Key Talking Points for Judges

### "Why would a business owner use this?"

1. **They're already losing money and don't know it.** 90% of SMBs lack proper attribution. They trust platform dashboards that double-count conversions.
2. **It works with their existing tools.** No new platforms to learn. Just connect what they already have — we pull the data and show the truth.
3. **It pays for itself in Week 1.** If you're spending ₱10,000/month on ads and 20% is wasted on isolated channels, that's ₱2,000/month saved immediately. Our pricing is ₱99-499/month.
4. **It's the only tool that shows the system.** Competitors show channel-by-channel. We show how channels amplify or undermine each other. That insight is worth more than any individual metric.

### "What's your competitive advantage?"

| Us | Competitors |
|----|------------|
| Dual tracking (Pixel + GA4) = 95% accuracy | Single source = 70% accuracy |
| Verify claims against actual payment data (Stripe/PayPal) | Trust platform self-reporting |
| System intelligence — synergies, isolation, reinforcement | Channel-by-channel only |
| Visual network map | Tables and basic charts |
| CAPI feedback loop — send verified data back to platforms | One-way data pull |
| AI decisions with financial impact | Vague "insights" |
| SMB pricing ($99-499/mo) | Enterprise pricing ($1,000+/mo) |

### "What's the market size?"

- $3.1B in 2022 → $10.6B by 2032 (13% CAGR)
- 65M businesses run digital ads globally
- 90% lack proper attribution
- Our target: SMBs spending $5K-$50K/month ($500K-$10M revenue)

## How to Get Business Owners to Use It

### The Hook — Lead with Pain, Not Features

Business owners don't care about "dual tracking" or "attribution models." They care about:

- **"Am I wasting money?"** — Yes, 20-30% of your ad budget goes to channels that don't work.
- **"Which ads actually work?"** — We'll show you verified revenue per channel, not platform guesses.
- **"What should I do differently?"** — We give you 3 specific actions with estimated financial impact.

### The Onboarding Promise — Value in Under 5 Minutes

1. Sign up (30 seconds)
2. Connect your platforms via OAuth (2 minutes)
3. Install the tracking pixel — one script tag (1 minute)
4. See your first performance dashboard with verified data (immediate)

**Day 1**: See platform claims vs actual sales — the gap is the wake-up call.
**Day 30**: Full system intelligence unlocks — synergies, journeys, AI recommendations.

### The Retention Loop — Why They Stay

- **Weekly email digest**: "This week: Facebook+Email drove ₱35,000. Instagram Ads lost ₱2,000. Action: scale email follow-ups."
- **Monthly system health score**: Goes up as they follow recommendations.
- **AI recommendations update daily**: Always fresh, always actionable.
- **CAPI feedback**: Their ad performance actually improves because we send verified conversions back to platforms, so the algorithms optimize on real data instead of inflated claims.

### Pricing That Removes Friction

| Tier | Price | For |
|------|-------|-----|
| Starter | $99/mo | 1-3 platforms, basic attribution |
| Growth | $249/mo | All platforms, system intelligence, AI recommendations |
| Scale | $499/mo | Agency/multi-brand, custom reports, API access |

**Free trial**: 14 days, full access. The "aha moment" hits when they see platform claims vs actual sales on Day 1.

## One-Liner Variations for Different Audiences

**For the technical judge**: *"We built a dual-tracking attribution engine that cross-references a custom pixel with GA4 and payment processors to achieve 95% conversion accuracy, then uses graph analysis to surface channel synergies that single-source tools miss entirely."*

**For the business judge**: *"We show business owners the truth about their marketing — which channels actually drive revenue, how they work together, and exactly what to change — saving them 20-30% of their ad budget in the first month."*

**For the marketing judge**: *"We're the anti-silo tool. Instead of optimizing Facebook in Facebook and Google in Google, we show how your whole marketing system works together — and where the real money is hiding."*

**For the investor judge**: *"$3.1B market growing to $10.6B, 90% of SMBs lack attribution, and we're the only platform combining enterprise accuracy with system intelligence at SMB pricing. We built the full stack in a hackathon."*
