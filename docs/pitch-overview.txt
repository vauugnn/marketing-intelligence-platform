INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM — PITCH OVERVIEW
=======================================
Prepared: February 2026


WHAT IT IS
----------
A marketing intelligence platform that shows businesses how their marketing
channels actually work together to drive revenue. It connects to platforms
like Google Analytics, Meta Ads, Stripe, and HubSpot — then reconstructs
real customer journeys, detects which channel combinations produce the
highest conversions, and delivers AI-powered recommendations on where to
spend next.


THE PROBLEM
-----------
Most marketing tools tell you what each channel did in isolation:
  - "Facebook got 2,000 clicks"
  - "Google Ads spent P50,000"
  - "Email had a 22% open rate"

But they can't answer the question that matters:
  "Which channels work TOGETHER to drive actual revenue?"

A customer might see a Facebook ad on Monday, search Google on Wednesday,
click an email on Friday, and buy on Saturday. Traditional analytics gives
100% credit to email (last click). The real story is that all three channels
played a role — and cutting Facebook would break the whole chain.


WHAT WE DO DIFFERENTLY
----------------------
1. PIXEL TRACKING
   A lightweight (<5KB) JavaScript snippet installed on the merchant's
   website. Captures every visitor session, UTM parameters, and page views.
   Works with Shopify, WordPress, Google Tag Manager, or any custom site.

2. CROSS-PLATFORM DATA UNIFICATION
   One-click OAuth connections to 7 platforms:
     - Google Analytics 4 (traffic & sessions)
     - Meta / Facebook Ads (ad spend & conversions)
     - Google Ads (search ad spend)
     - Stripe (payment revenue)
     - PayPal (payment revenue)
     - HubSpot (CRM deals & pipeline)
     - Mailchimp (email campaign performance)

   All data flows into one normalized database — no CSV exports, no
   manual uploads, no spreadsheet stitching.

3. JOURNEY RECONSTRUCTION
   The engine links pixel sessions to verified conversions (actual sales
   from Stripe/PayPal). For each conversion, it rebuilds the full
   customer journey:
     Session 1: Facebook ad click (Day 1)
     Session 2: Google search (Day 3)
     Session 3: Email click (Day 5) -> Purchase (P4,500)

   This produces a channel sequence: [facebook, google, email] — the
   real path to purchase.

4. SYNERGY DETECTION
   From thousands of journeys, the platform calculates which channel
   PAIRS amplify each other. The synergy score compares multi-touch
   revenue to solo-touch revenue:

     Example:
       Facebook solo conversions average:   P1,500
       Google solo conversions average:      P2,800
       Facebook + Google journeys average:   P6,400
       Synergy Score = 6,400 / 2,800 = 2.29x (Strong)

   Translation: When Facebook and Google appear together in a journey,
   the conversion is worth 2.3x more than Google alone. Cutting Facebook
   would cost far more than its solo numbers suggest.

5. AI RECOMMENDATIONS
   Google Gemini analyzes performance data, synergy scores, and channel
   roles to generate actionable recommendations:

     SCALE:    "Increase Facebook Ads budget by 30% — strong synergy
                with Google drives P8,100 avg multi-touch conversions"
     OPTIMIZE: "Refine email targeting — pair with Google for 1.8x lift"
     STOP:     "Pause underperforming Instagram campaigns — reallocate
                P12,000/month to Facebook-Google funnel"

   Each recommendation includes confidence %, estimated monthly impact
   in pesos, and an AI-written explanation of why it matters.

HOW IT WORKS (TECHNICAL SUMMARY)
---------------------------------
Architecture: Monorepo with 4 packages
  - Frontend:  React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind (Vite, port 3000)
  - Backend:   Express + TypeScript (port 3001)
  - Pixel:     Webpack bundle, ES2015 target (port 3002)
  - Shared:    TypeScript types + utility functions

Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
  - Tables: users, platform_connections, raw_events, pixel_events,
    verified_conversions, ai_recommendations

Background Jobs (node-cron, Manila timezone):
  - Midnight: Attribution engine links conversions to journeys
  - 2:00 AM:  Gemini AI generates enhanced recommendations

Auth: OAuth 2.0 for all platforms, Passport.js, encrypted token storage

Data freshness: Platforms sync every 6 hours, pixel events are real-time,
attribution recalculates daily, AI recommendations refresh with 5-min cache.


KEY METRICS FOR THE DEMO
-------------------------
With seed data loaded (4 channels, 90 days):

  Channels:       Facebook, Google, Email, Instagram
  Journeys:       96 conversion journeys
  Spend Events:   52 (4 channels x 13 weeks)

  Top Synergy:    Facebook + Google = ~2.5x (Strong)
  Channel Roles:  Google = Closer, Facebook = Introducer,
                  Email = Introducer, Instagram = Isolated

  The demo shows a clear story: Facebook drives awareness, Google closes
  sales, and together they produce 2.5x higher conversion value than
  either channel alone. Instagram operates independently with low synergy
  — a candidate for budget reallocation.


TARGET MARKET
-------------
  - Philippine SMBs and mid-market businesses running multi-channel marketing
  - E-commerce merchants on Shopify / WooCommerce
  - Marketing agencies managing multiple client accounts
  - Any business spending on 2+ marketing platforms that wants to understand
    cross-channel ROI
